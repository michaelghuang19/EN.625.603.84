You could also do a quick line fit or get its correlation. Correlation is with “cor()”. A line fit can be achieved using the linear model function. Two commands, model<-lm(response~predictor), followed by summary(model) will give you least squares result for an individual predictor (e.g., smoker) against the response. This will give you a rough idea of what might be important. Try for regressions 2 through 11.\n"
