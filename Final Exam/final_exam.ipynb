    "I wasn't aware of the marginal effect of age on earnings decreasing over time. I think that I had some thoughts around ageism in certain industries and how this would affect overall employment, which in turn could possibly mean that there may be a tendency for older people to be better paid and therefore for earnings to accelerate more steeply on average for higher ages. The regressions seem to generally reflect that this is not the case. In addition, the effect of gender seemed to generally be rather small on earnings, which I also found to be interesting and could warrant further investigation into furhter breakdowns such as categorizations of jobs and career lengths."
